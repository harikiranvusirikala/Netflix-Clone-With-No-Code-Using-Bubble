===
Database(as Data in the left nav bar):
Data Types -> Data Field name(recommended to have - instead of space in between), Data Field type
Option Sets -> Data Field name, Constant values (like Enum)

===
Every page first update Container Layout to Column.

Design section(in left nav bar):
Each thing is a container on the page.
We can add a group (a container) on a page. And recommend setting a flat colour when updating it so it is easy to understand how it is.
Rename the Input A -> Input Register-email.

Style(in the left nav bar) is a set of CSS for a button/input/etc which we use all over the app.

Workflow(in the left nav bar) is the actions to be performed on clicking buttons etc.

Register in preview. And can see user registration in Database -> App data -> All Users

===
Design the Subscription on the same registration page and hide the first email registration container with a workflow.
• This element is visible on page load - only for email registration container
• Collapse when hidden
• Animate the collapse operation - Fade In/Out

===
Create a stripe.com account and it's a plugin to process payment.
Update Client ID(from Settings -> Connect -> Onboarding options -> OAuth), Secret Key, and Publishable Key for both live and development.

Create a product in the Product catalog for a monthly subscription plan.

Recommended updating workflows on the same page with one colour.

Stripe dummy credit cards for testing - https://docs.stripe.com/testing?testing-method=card-numbers#cards

Error:
As per Indian regulations, export transactions require a customer name and address. More info here: https://stripe.com/docs/india-exports

===
Designing the Home page

Unlike other applications like Wordpress which shows static content, Bubble shows dynamic content.

Adding a Hero-content:
• Display the content's details that are published.
• Check "Resize to fit the dimensions by cropping" in processed with Imgix for the background image.
• Use static image while developing and revert it to dynamic when running.

Use Repeating Groups - to display dynamic lists of things from the database

===
Designing the Admin page

Admin page design is an assumption as we don't know how it looks.

For every Group update Min height to 0 after the Group is completely designed to remove unnecessary spaces.
Remove the background colour of groups when making the application live.

===
Designing the Create page to upload a movie.

No need for navigation for both the Admin & Create pages.

Use the "Multiselect Dropdown" plugin to have an input field that allows you to select more than one.

xano.com and plugin Ziggeo are more ways to save the videos that we can stream.

Custom state(select the page -> i -> Custom state) is where data is saved on the page, so can be accessible via another group.

Add alert on successful upload.
