Every page first update Container Layout to Column.

Each thing is a container on the page.
We can add a group (a container) on a page. And recommend setting a flat colour when updating it so it is easy to understand how it is.
Rename the Input A -> Input Register-email.

Style(in the left nav bar) is a set of CSS for a button/input/etc which we use all over the app.

Workflow(in the left nav bar) is the actions to be performed on clicking buttons etc.

Register in preview. And can see user registration in Database -> App data -> All Users

Design the Subscription on the same registration page and hide the first email registration container with a workflow.
• This element is visible on page load - only for email registration container
• Collapse when hidden
• Animate the collapse operation - Fade In/Out

Update Client ID(from Settings -> Connect -> Onboarding options -> OAuth), Secret Key, and Publishable Key for both live and development.

===
Designing the Home page

Unlike other applications like Wordpress which shows static content, Bubble shows dynamic content.

Adding a Hero-content:
• Display the content's details that are published.
• Check "Resize to fit the dimensions by cropping" in processed with Imgix for the background image.
• Use static image while developing and revert it to dynamic when running.

Use Repeating Groups - to display dynamic lists of things from the database
